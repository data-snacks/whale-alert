In this repositry you can find a workflow where I try to understand: 'What is a whale' in terms of money and also in amount of crypto asset. In general we think about the whale as an amount of money. But I whant to know: how many BTCs, ETHs, and etc are whales. This amount is affected by the price fluctuations.
